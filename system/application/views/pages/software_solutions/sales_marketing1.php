<p>Accessing management information on proposals and/or the customer lease portfolio has previously
been an impossible task. Our dashboards share relevant information across complicated hierarchical
structures across multiple organisations to enable the sales process.</p>

<p>For companies reliant upon leasing providing real time information on the status of proposals
is imperative for accurate forecasting and results. Our customers view vital information in easy
to comprehend graphical formats. Powerful contact management functionality and alert system
enables transparency to all those concerned with a proposal. Outlook integration (or other local
email clients) allows user to manage communication calendars and tasks from within Lease-

and now the sales teams and managers have access to the vital information on Repeat Business
Opportunities (RBO) to close cross-selling or upgrade opportunities.</p>
